This is a repository you can use to start your HTML/CSS/JavaScript project.

I have included: index.html, styles.css, main.js, and bs.bat - the batch file that will start browser-sync automatically

There is also a .gitignore which will cause GitHub to ignore a bunch of files that shouldn't be stored (like temp files, log files, node libraries, etc)

Make sure you edit *this file* (REAMDE.md), delete all this information and put in your name and a short description of this project.

Then, edit index.html and add your name in the author meta field. 

Finally, commit and push to make sure it's working for you.
